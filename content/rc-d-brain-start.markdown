Waking up in the mornings at 7am = not exactly fun at all, especially
when you've just lost an hour over the weekend. This upcoming week, I'm
hoping to finish version 0.2 of addpisg.sh.  
This would essentially mean that addpisg would be able completely
automate adding a new channel to pisg and make it display on the web
server. It still will not be able to do any extra options, like ignoring
users, but it will have the most basic options for the config to work.

The week after I will be on spring break, so perhaps I will be able to
do even more with this project.

Here's what I have planned in addpisg:

- Completely interactive menu instead of just static prompts
- Comprehensive options (depends on interactive menu)
- Possibly a web frontend?

heh.
