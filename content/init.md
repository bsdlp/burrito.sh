So I decided to start a new blog, one that will serve as the main page
to sjchen.com as I work on actually making my site presentable. This
blog will serve as a scratch pad for my thoughts, and maybe some reviews
of my life and events around me. This wordpress site is running on a low
end vps with a remote mysql database and nginx. Hopefully that'll be
enough to run smoothly.
