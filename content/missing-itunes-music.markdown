*SO MANY EXCLAMATION MARKS ON MY iTUNES LIBRARY! WHAT DO I DO?*

So you've recently re-installed your computer, or you got that shiny new
computer. You're a smart guy and transferred all of your music including
the "iTunes Library.itl" file. But the problem is you forgot that you
deleted a bunch of music before you transferred, and for whatever reason
the iTunes Library didn't pick up on the change. Well, what do you do?
It's not like they're all bunched up or anything... Chances are they're
peppered through your huge library. You've got missing iTunes music! But
don't worry!

*Here's where Google comes in handy!*

Step 1:
=======

Click on the + symbol on the bottom of the page. This will create a new,
empty playlist. Let's name is DATNEWPLAYLIST (you can really call it
anything you want). Go back to your main library, and press ctrl-a (or
cmd-a if you're on mac) to select all of your music. Click and drag the
whole shebang to DATNEWPLAYLIST, the new playlist you made earlier.

*pro tip: you may need to hold down the mouse button until you see the
plus symbol under your cursor while dragging your library to the new
playlist*

Step 2:
=======

Hold down your shift key, and click on the gear symbol that appeared
where the new playlist button used to live at the bottom left of iTunes.
This creates a smart playlist. For the first dropdown box, change that
"*Playlist*". The second dropdown, "is *not*". And in the last
dropdown, choose that new playlist you made in step 1. Make sure the
Live updating checkbox is checked. Press OK!

[][]

Step 3:
=======

In the new smart playlist you made, you'll see all of the songs that
have exclamation marks next to them, indicating that they were files
that iTunes was unable to find. *CAUTION!* Podcasts and video make it
into this smart playlist, for whatever reason. Be sure to not select
them. So break out that shift / ctrl and delete those missing files!

Step 4:
=======

Enjoy that clean music library!
