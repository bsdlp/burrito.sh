According to [eff.org][] and [arstechnica][], a number of major US ISP's
including AT&T, Comcast, Verizon and Time Warner are initiating a pretty
influential program to punish users for various "infractions". For
example, ISP's will issue "alerts" with some consequence tied to each
type of alert, such as bandwidth throttling and account suspension. I'm
not surprised that this kind of deal has been in the works, but I am
surprised by how no consumer advocates were involved in the discussion.
This just increases the companies' already unbalanced power over
consumers in the United States.

I'm curious to see how the internet responds to this move. Will there be
a SOPA/PIPA style reaction that reverses the program? Or will the
consumers fail to recognize the significance of this deal?
