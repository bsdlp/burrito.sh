<!-- PELICAN_BEGIN_SUMMARY -->
There are many reasons why you should put away your shopping carts, and I want
each and every one of you to take a few seconds to push your cart to the corral
when you're finished unloading.
<!-- PELICAN_END_SUMMARY -->

Shopping carts are a necessity at the store. Can you imagine walking through a
grocery store and purchasing multiple items without one? You would be juggling
ice-cold frozen foods, bulky boxes containing cleaning supplies, and small
fruits. Almost everyone grabs a cart when they enter the store, yet how often
have you noticed that there aren't enough carts to go around? I can't remember
the last time that's happened to me. This is due to the efforts of a number of
employees whose job it is to round up the carts and return them to the line
outside of the entrance. These people work when it's cold, when it's snowing,
when it's humid, when it's raining, when it's hot. Why not spend a few extra
seconds to push your cart into the corral so that these guys don't need to run
around the parking lot collecting single carts in the weather?

But maybe I should not have led off with an appeal to help out your local
shop's employees. These days, it's hard to piece together a few moments for
oneself to think about things. So, when you're making someone else's life
easier by putting away your shopping cart, take a few moments to think about
the day, or anything at all. You may also think about those times when people
have left shopping carts in the last parking spot, forcing you to get out and
push the cart away before parking your car. Or maybe you will remember that
time when a cart rolled down the parking lot and struck your bumper, leaving a
mark.

Please! Put away your shopping carts.
