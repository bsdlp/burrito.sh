So check it:  
Where do we find the best hardware, especially GPU's, on the internet?
You can't exploit people already running dedicated farms, as they'll
notice a dip in productivity. You probably won't have a good time
hitting up commercial hardware, as you'll likely get noticed, and you'll
probably get in trouble with the authorities.

So where would an enterprising person on the internet go to reach
thousands of top-level hardware and run bitcoin mining software without
getting noticed, and for free?

Gamers.

In North American Counter Strike, the only league worth playing in is
[ESEA][]. They provide an "industry leading anti-cheat client" (their
words), host big LANs at the end of each season with pretty generous
prize pots, and provide servers for pickup games, scrims and more. Their
anti-cheat client, which is required if one wants to play on their
servers, gives the ESEA developers a lot of power at their disposal.

Most gamers aren't technical people. Sure, you would think that people
who spend a big chunk of their lives in front of computers would know
more about the hardware they spend so much time with. However, I don't
know how many times I've heard people just throw out panaceas like "just
reinstall," or "scan it with x, it's a virus!" without actually knowing
what causes computer issues.

So it's not terribly surprising that ESEA was able to run a botnet
comprised of pretty much the entire competitive North American Counter
Strike scene. I haven't received confirmation if their European or South
American branches were affected as well.

Here are the original forum threads on the issue. Remember, this is a
forum for gamers, so please don't be surprised if there are a lot of
immature posts. You can basically skip the rest of the thread if you
just read the OP.

Take from this what you will.
