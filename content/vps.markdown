Recently I really got into browsing the internets for deals on virtual
private servers, especially low end boxes that go for under \$10 a
month. A friend of mine had been telling me about prgmr.com's xen vps's,
and when I finally told myself to start a website, I looked deeper.

**Lowendbox.com / Lowendtalk.com :**  
LEB/LET is the 1-2 punch behind the low end vps market. The main rule
of LEB is that any VPS offers posted has to be under \$7. The deals go
from the absurd (Hostsnowy) to the surprisingly reliable (ChicagoVPS) to
the "do-no-wrong" (buyvm). Not only do the ridiculously low price points
appeal to potential customers, but the intense discussions on the LET
forums provides insight into one of the most competitive online markets.

**webhostingtalk.com :**  
Effectively the biggest web hosting forum on the internet, WHT provides
grounds for industry announcements, VPS/Cloud
server/dedicated/shared/email/dns hosting offers and much more.
Essentially it covers everything there is to cover for those who want to
create a presence on the net. However, I find that WHT is very spammy,
and there are no rules for provider advertisement posts and members are
not as passionate as those of LET, there is a higher amount of scam/bad
providers who post there. If you know enough to tell between the bad
providers and the good ones, WHT is a good way to keep an eye on
potential providers.
