Oh [hyde][], why is your documentation utterly useless? I just want a
static site generator that uses the awesome jinja2 template syntax, and
your project seems to be perfect for me. But your documentation is
outdated!

I guess I'll go with [Frozen-Flask][], which is kind of a work-around,
as instead of just writing posts, you have to write a flask application
first. Does anyone have a good static site/blog generator that uses
jinja2?
