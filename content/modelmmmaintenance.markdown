<!-- PELICAN_BEGIN_SUMMARY -->
The venerated IBM Model M is an invincible keyboard. I have one that's older
than me. The buckling spring switches are a joy to type on, but due to the age
of these boards, we need to do a bit of maintenance to get things running
even better.

## Materials

First things first, we need to buy some materials.

Here's what you need, with links to Amazon pages to the stuff I can find. You
obviously don't need to buy them from Amazon, and they are not affiliate links.

* [grease](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000AL8VD2/): Make sure that this
  is recommended for "electrical connections".
* [hex nut driver](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00365EYM6/): You'll
  want the 5.5mm version. (optional)
* [PS2 to USB Adapter](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000BSJFJS/): This is
  probably the best one you can buy.
* Q-tips
* Denture cleaner. You know, the ones that look like alka-seltzer and are
  bubbly when you put it in water.
* Paper clip. I used one of those wire tie jawns, and stripped off the plastic
  on one end because I was too lazy to find a paper clip.
* [Keycap
  puller](http://techkeys.us/collections/accessories/products/keycap-puller):
  You'll want to use this for easy removal of keys.
* Can of compressed air. (optional but highly recommended)

That's pretty much all you need.

At this point, you may wish to put your laundry in the washer, making sure 
that at least one pillowcase is in the mix.

## Disassembly

Flip over the board and use the nut driver to remove the four nuts at the top 
of the back of the board.

The next thing you want to do when disassembling the Model M is to pull off
the keycaps. Use the keycap puller, wrap the arms around a key, turn a bit
clockwise or counterclockwise, and pull up. You need to do this because the
legends on the Model M keycaps are removable from the actual keycap. Keep in
mind the larger keys (backspace, enter, etc) need a bit more love, and I would
usually do them last so there's more space to get your puller in a good
position.

Watch out for the spacebar and the + and Enter keys on the numpad, as they have
stabilisers. Don't pull too hard or you'll break it.

If this is your first time cleaning the board, or if you just acquired this
board, then you'll most likely want to throw up around this point. 

Pull apart the front facade from the back. Keep in mind that the little
connector jawns are on the bottom of the board, so be careful. You don't need
to worry about wires, as the front isn't connected to anything else.

Next, make sure the ps/2 cable is disconnected. Then, take the board and go to
town on it with the compressed air. You'll want to do the same with the nooks
and crannies of the front and back covers.

## Cleaning

Get a container, like a bucket or something, and throw your keycaps in there.
For a set of caps on a full-sized Model M, I would recommend putting in two
tabs of denture cleaner. Make sure that the tabs are on the bottom of the pile,
and cover the pile with just enough warm water.

Once you've got most of the crap out, take your q-tips and dip them in the
water with the denture cleaner, and rub off the more stubborn crap.

Some people claim that it's safe and effective to put your front and back
covers in the dishwasher, but I didn't. You may have some luck with that method
as well.

Once you're done with that, and the denture cleaner has done the needful, go
ahead and wash off each keycap, using a q-tip or some paper towel to wipe off
any crap as needed.

Now, take the wet pillowcase from the washer, and throw your keycaps in there.
Make sure that the metal stabilisers are NOT in the pillowcase. Remove them
from the caps, and throw the caps in the pillowcase. Put your pillowcase in the
dryer with the rest of your load.

## Lube

While your caps are drying out, grab the tube of grease, and dip the paper clip
in the tube, making sure you only get a little bit on the paper clip. Push your
paper clip into the middle of each spring, twisting it so the grease rubs off.
Make sure you avoid touching the plastic barrel. Keep in mind that if you
overapply the grease, you may have some trouble getting the keystroke to
trigger.

## Reassembly

Put together everything, and enjoy your like-new Model M :)
