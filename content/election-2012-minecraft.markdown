I just put my fist voter registration form in the mail. I don't expect
anything to go sideways, and so this will be my first time voting, ever.
I'm quite excited, although I'm not too sure I'm psyched for the
expected lines at the voting location.

Also, I have a pretty successful minecraft community running now on a
dedicated server that I configured myself. I'm running craftbukkit,
murmur, dynmap, craftIRC, phpbb forums, a static homepage, and a word
press blog. This all runs on nginx+php-fpm on debian squeeze. Here are
the server specs:  
Amd opteron 2222  
8gb ddr2 ecc ram  
146 gb sas drive

It's really holding up well in terms of performance. Haven't had any
unplanned downtime at all. I would highly recommend [datashack][]to
anyone in the market for an affordable yet reliable dedicated server.

If you would like to join our vanilla pve community oriented server, and
please post on the [forums][] for whitelisting.
