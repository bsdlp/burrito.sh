So the summer job hunt officially begins for me this spring break. Over
the past few days and for the rest of this week, I will be scouring the
internet and local businesses for someone who will be willing to pick up
a freshman electrical engineering major from the University of Illinois.
A freshman who thinks he knows java, python, c, bash scripting, html and
css, with experience in linux administration.

Sadly, not many businesses who usually hire students during the summer
are hiring as eagerly as they did in the past. Hopefully I'm one of the
lucky few, but I wouldn't mind going ahead and doing some summer
sessions at Rutgers to put away from general education credits.

If for some reason I don't manage to find a job, my plan is to take some
courses at Rutgers for the first half of the summer and then go away to
Taiwan/Hong Kong for the rest of the summer to visit my Grandmother.
Either way, it's not a bad summer plan, in my opinion. Of course, my
mother thinks that if I don't get a job, it will pretty much be the end
of the world.

Off to complete some more job applications.
