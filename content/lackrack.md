The [LACK side table][] is an extremely cheap and versatile table, that
apparently doubles as a modular rack. My Dell PowerEdge 1950 should be
able to fit in perfectly, so I'm considering heading over to IKEA and
pick up a table just to try out. They're mad cheap, so even if the
lackrack doesn't work out, I'm sure there's somewhere I can put a small
table in my house.
