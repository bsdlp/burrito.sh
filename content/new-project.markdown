So I just started a new project this weekend.

I've been eyeing twitter's bootstrap for a while now, and now I finally
get to use it. Bootstrap is a css/jquery package that allows you to
format your webpage in a gorgeous manner. In addition, since it works
with html5, you can get standardized user experience across all devices.
Right now I'm working on getting the base functionality of the site
down, and then I will begin work on customizing the css and and
javascript and then eventually I'll create an MVC to support it. You can
look watch and/or fork the development over at github:

The site is located [here](http://urtdevs.com).
